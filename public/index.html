  <h4 class="headers">Goalkeeping, as in Soccer!</h4>

  <p>I was raised in a country that loves baseball but somehow I got attached to a small sport named soccer (I'd found out later
    that it is actually not that small of a sport). I started playing when I was 6 years old and although I was never technically
    gifted my size at that time helped me overcome those early steps. When I turned 8 I started Goalkeeping by chance, and
    never looked back. Nowadays, my favorite thing to do is go out and play.</p>

    <P id=list>The things I like the most about soccer are:</P>
    <ul>
      <li>It is simple</li>
      <li>It is very educating</li>
      <li>It is fun</li>
      <li>It brings people together</li>
    </ul>
