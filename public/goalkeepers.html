    <h4 class="headers">What is a Soccer Goalkeeper?</h4>

    <section>
        <p>The soccer goalkeeper is one of the most important players on the field - they are the last line of defense and the
            first line of attack. To play the position well requires special skills and training. To many coaches, though,
            soccer goalkeeping techniques and tactics are a mystery. This is especially true at younger age levels, where
            often coaches have not played much soccer at all, much less played keeper. Even experienced field players and
            coaches may not have much experience with goalkeeping.</p>
